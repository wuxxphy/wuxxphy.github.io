<h2>Academic Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Xiaoxiao Wu is an Assistant Professor of Advanced Materials Thrust at HKUST(GZ). He received Bachelor’s degree in Physics from Nanjing University in 2014, and PhD degree in Physics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2018. Before joining HKUST(GZ), he was a post-doctoral researcher in Prof. Xiang Zhang’s group in HKU from 2019 to 2022. His research features extraordinary manipulations of waves beyond conventional limits using metamaterials, which control wave-matter interaction on demand through designed ensembles of artificial structures (“meta-atoms”). With a problem-driven approach, his research experiences span on a variety areas of metamaterials, including wave-functional metamaterials, which aim at challenges impossible for plain natural materials, and topological metamaterials, which aim at exploring the profound topological physics in photonic and phononic systems for fundamental progress and also exotic applications. </p>
